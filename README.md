# LinkedList

This generic templated singly Linked List data structure (unsorted) will create a Linked List object with a head pointer and size. The pointer will point to and keep track of a dynamically allocated link of nodes and be able to perform basic Linked List operations operations: 

* Search
* Insert
* Delete
* Get Entry
* Set Entry

## Purpose

To provide a templated simple singly linked list data structure to be used in any C++ program.  

## Configure
