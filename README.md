# LinkedList

This generic templated singly Linked List data structure (unsorted) will create a Linked List object with a head pointer and size. The pointer will point to and keep track of a dynamically allocated link of nodes and be able to perform basic Linked List operations operations: 

* Search
  * Time Complexity: Best (O(1)) Worst (O(n))
* Insert
  * Time Complexity: Best (O(1)) Worst (O(n))
* Remove
  * Time Complexity: Best (O(1)) Worst (O(n))
* Clear 
  * Time Complexity: Best (O(1)) Worst (O(n))
* Get Entry
  * Time Complexity: Best (O(1)) Worst (O(n))
* Set Entry
  * Time Complexity: Best (O(1)) Worst (O(n))

## Purpose

To provide a templated simple singly linked list data structure to be used in any C++ program.  

## Configure

Remove Makefile and main.cpp
Add to personal code and Makefile 
Include with `#include "LinkedList.h"`


## Tests

#### **Currently working on adding test cases!**
